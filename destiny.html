<h2> june 2 the day when the red string connected us જ⁀➴ </h2>

<p>
    To be honest, when I was coming to Chennai, I had prayed to God that I wouldn’t meet you. However, a part of my heart kept whispering that it wanted to see your face, hold your hand for a while, and witness that feminine smile I love—the most blissful thing in my life. I would do anything to bring that smile to your face.

I still remember that day. I had never planned to go to Bessie that evening, but my heart said, “Go to the place where you find peace in Chennai.” Eventually, my instincts led me to Bessie Beach, because that place is so special to me.

When I reached Church Street, I prayed again—for our paths to cross. As I entered the beach, I stood somewhere for a while, but something told me to move to the right. That’s when I saw a girl sitting on the sand, wearing headphones and carrying a handbag. At that very moment, I felt I knew that face—it was so familiar. I hesitated to ask her, so I decided to sit nearby and listen to songs that reminded me of you.

After a few minutes, I couldn’t control the urge to know if it was really you—my girl, Narmu. So I asked, “Hello, excuse me, is your name Narmu?” And you replied by gently nodding your head.

That was our first meetup, and I had the opportunity to breathe the same air as you. We caught up with each other, sat side by side for almost an hour, and talked about so many things. That’s when I realized <a href="https://youtu.be/Ld7jaFqxTCs"> The red string of fate </a>
 isn’t a myth. It’s real.

    <h2>  walking through the streets of heaven </h2>

</div>
<div class="maincontent">
Now,my favorite part of the day when i held your hand for the very first time and walking through the streets of heaven.coz,your my <span id="myangel" style=" cursor:pointer;color: magenta; text-decoration: underline;" > guardian angel</span> who came from heaven to be with me forever.that time i wanted to sing a song that called "Kaikorthu pogum indhaa saalai pothathey. Then,we reached the bus stop and boarded the bus to Saidapet. During the ride, I asked if you wanted to eat something once we reached our destination. When we arrived at Saidapet Metro, you took me to your favorite tea shop — the one you often visited. We both ordered ginger tea, clinked our cups in a cheerful “cheers,” and you captured a few pictures of the moment. After sipping the tea, we sat at the entrance of the metro station, where you showed me your recent Narmadha vlog and some lovely pictures of Azhagi. I noticed that whenever you laughed, you gently leaned on my shoulder — a blissful gesture that etched itself into my heart forever. Though you said it was time to leave, I sensed you truly wanted to spend more time with me. Then came the most unexpected and hilarious moment: you grabbed my hand and ran with me to catch a bus. I never imagined you’d do that, and it made me laugh with joy. After those magical moments, we said goodbye and headed home, each carrying the warmth of a day that will always remain unforgettable.
